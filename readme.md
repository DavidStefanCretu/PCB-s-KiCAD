## Project Overview

This repository serves as a collection of PCB projects designed in KiCAD. It includes schematic diagrams, board layouts, footprints, and project documentation to help users understand, modify, and manufacture the boards.

---

## Features

- **KiCAD Project Files**: Includes `.kicad_pro`, `.kicad_pcb`, and schematic files (`.kicad_sch`).
- **Component Libraries**: Custom and standard KiCAD footprints/libraries.
- **Manufacturing Outputs**: Gerber files and BOMs for PCB fabrication.
- **Modular Design**: Organized directory structure for multiple projects or revisions.
- **Documentation**: Each PCB project includes comments and documentation for easy understanding.

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the Repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/DavidStefanCretu/PCB-s-KiCAD.git
   ```
2. **Open with KiCAD**
   - Download and install [KiCAD](https://www.kicad.org/download/).
   - Open any `.kicad_pro` project file within the repository to start editing or viewing the boards.

3. **Explore the Designs**
   - Schematics: View or modify electronic circuit diagrams.
   - PCB Layout: Inspect board layouts, routing, and layers.
   - Libraries: Add or update custom footprints and symbols as needed.

---

## Usage Instructions

- **Edit Designs**: Open the desired KiCAD project and use the EDA tools to modify schematics or layouts.
- **Generate Manufacturing Files**: Use KiCAD’s plot and export features to generate Gerber files and BOMs for PCB fabrication.
- **Simulate Circuits**: KiCAD includes basic simulation tools for verifying circuit behavior.
- **Document Projects**: Add or update project-level README.md files to describe specific boards, components, and intended use.
